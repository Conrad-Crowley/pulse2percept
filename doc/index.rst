Pulse2percept: models for sight restoration
============================================

What would the world look like to someone with a bionic eye?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

More than 20 million Americans aged 18 and older have experienced vision loss,
according to the `American Foundation for the Blind <http://www.afb.org/info/blindness-statistics/adults/facts-and-figures/235>`_,
and the rates of vision loss are expected to double by 2030 as the nation's
population ages. A variety of sight recovery therapies are being developed by
companies around the world, offering new hope for people who are blind. But
little is known about what the world will look like to patients who undergo such
procedures.

We have developed a computer model of what someone with restored vision might
see. This computer model creates a 'virtual patient' who can give scientists and
patients into the vision that these prostheses might provide.

A virtual patient
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following videos show a simulation of the vision of a patient implanted with
an electronic prosthesis like the `Argus
II  <http://www.secondsight.com/g-the-argus-ii-prosthesis-system-pf-en.html>`_. The Argus II bionic eye system is the major electrical prosthesis
device on the market. It uses a digital camera mounted to a pair of eyeglasses
that sends visual data to a computer chip implanted on the side of the eye. This
chip then activates a small array of electrodes implanted in the retina that
stimulates retinal cells to convert that data into vision.

The videos show that patients may see fuzzy, comet-like shapes or blurred
outlines, or experience temporary disappearances if the object moves too fast.

One goal of this project is to provide information about the quality of vision
people can expect if they undergo sight restoration surgery. Models like these
can also help scientists improve future implants by providing insights into
which aspects of the technology are limiting performance.
